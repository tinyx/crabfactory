===========
This is my personal website based on Django.

I've already done a todo-list app based on ASP.NET, so the first thing is to convert it into Django.
And I also have some other thoughts to be achieved after that.

The todo-list for this project so far is:

- [x] Create initial files for the project.
- [x] Configure Apache2 to make the project reachable through the Internet
- [x] Convert the 2do-list from ASP.NET to Django
