The portfolio of mine, also as entrance for my other websites.

[Todo-list](http://todo.crabfactory.net "2-do list")

I did a todo-list app based on ASP.NET, and converted it to Django at some point.

Rewriting progress:

- [x] Create initial files for the project.
- [x] Configure Apache2 to make the project reachable through the Internet
- [x] Convert the 2do-list from ASP.NET to Django
- [x] Review all the js code and do a cleanup of them
- [x] Re-write all the CSS codes with LESS

[Todo v2](http://todov2.crabfactory.net "Todo v2")

An experimental project for learning React, Redux tech stack.

Took advantages of Material-UI so I can focus on the structure of the project.

===========
[Gallery](http://gallery.crabfactory.net "Gallery")

Portfolio website for one of my artist friend. 

Old school jQuery page, nothing fancy on the tech perspective.
